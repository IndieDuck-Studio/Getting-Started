# Project Documentation
## Overview
Provide a brief overview of the project, its purpose, and goals. Explain the technologies and frameworks used in the development process.

So this is the beginning of your journey in IndieDuck-Studio!
Engine for Game Development is **Unity Engine**:
C# (Dotnet) as default coding Conventions and Principles [Microsoft C# Documentation]([https://pages.github.com/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/))

Coding Conventions
Naming Conventions
Classes and Structs: Use PascalCase.
Methods and Functions: Use PascalCase.
Variables and Parameters: Use camelCase.
Constants: Use ALL_CAPS.
Enums: Use PascalCase for enum types and PascalCase or ALL_CAPS for enum values, depending on the situation.
Code Formatting
Indentation: Use spaces for indentation with a consistent number of spaces (e.g., 4 spaces).
Braces: Place opening braces on the same line as the corresponding statement or declaration. Use a new line for closing braces.
Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 120 characters.
Comments: Use XML comments for public members, and single-line or multi-line comments for code explanations and clarifications.
Documentation Comments
Use XML documentation comments to provide descriptive and meaningful documentation for classes, methods, properties, and parameters.
Include information about the purpose, usage, and expected behavior of each member.
Document any exceptions that can be thrown and any specific considerations for using the member.
Design Principles
Explain the design principles followed by the team in the project. For example:

SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or module should have only one reason to change.
Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle
Avoid duplicating code or logic. Encourage modularization and reuse of common functionality.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle
Strive for simplicity and readability in code and design. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Design Patterns
Document the design patterns utilized in the project, along with their purpose and usage. Include examples where appropriate. Some common design patterns used in C# projects are:

Singleton Pattern
Factory Pattern
Builder Pattern
Observer Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Decorator Pattern
File and Folder Structure
Explain the organization of files and folders within the project. Describe the purpose and contents of each major directory. For example:

Assets/: Contains all game assets, such as models, textures, and audio files.
Scripts/: Contains all C# scripts organized by functionality or module.
UI/: Contains all user interface-related scripts, prefabs, and assets.
Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries
List any third-party libraries, frameworks, or APIs used in the project. Include their purpose, version, and relevant documentation links.

Build and Deployment
Document the build and deployment process for the project. Include steps, configurations, and any required tools or scripts.

Testing and Quality Assurance
Explain the testing approach followed by the team, including unit testing, integration testing, and any additional quality assurance measures.

Maintenance and Support
Provide guidelines for maintaining the project, handling bug reports, and addressing support requests.

Version Control
Explain the Git workflow used by the team, including branch naming conventions, commit message guidelines, and repository management.
